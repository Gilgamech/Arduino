My bot is named Frubot

Normal actions
Frubot makes a list of all fruit on gameboard
-List needs to hold type and location
-List needs a list number?
-List needs to identify if the fruit's in a group?

-How often to update list?
-Should we update the list and preference separately?

Frubot orders list by preference
-Preference is adjusted so fruit types with few pieces have higher preference than those with more pieces
-Preference is adjusted by distance to next piece of fruit
-Maybe Frubot will prefer a rare type more than a more common type?
-Frubot will pick up fruit if the fruit is in its path to another type of fruit
-Frubot picks up fruit adjacent to its path

Actions if Simplebot is near
-Reactions need to be adjusted for large v small boards
